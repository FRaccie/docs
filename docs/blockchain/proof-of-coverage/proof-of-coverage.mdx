## Proof of Coverage

The Helium blockchain uses a novel work algorithm called "Proof of Coverage" (PoC) to verify that
Hotspots accurately represent their location, configuration, and the wireless network coverage they
create.

## Why Proof of Coverage?

The Helium Network is a physical wireless network that succeeds based on the reliable coverage it
can create for users deploying connected devices. As such, it required a working algorithm built for
this use case. Proof-of-Coverage takes advantage of radio frequency's (RF) unique, undeniable
properties to produce meaningful proofs to the Helium Network and its participants. Specifically,
PoC relies on the following characteristics:

- RF has limited physical propagation and, therefore, distance.
- The strength of a received RF signal is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from
  the transmitter.
- RF travels at the speed of Light with (effectively) no latency.

The Helium blockchain uses the data generated by ongoing proofs to verify the wireless coverage
provided by Hotspots on the Network.

## Off-Chain Proof-of-Coverage

:::note Off-Chain PoC Hotspot Requirements

Off-Chain PoC will requires miner version 2022.12.13.0 or later.

:::

Off-Chain Proof-of-Coverage allows Hotspots to Beacon on their own every 6 hours to participate in
Proof-of-Coverage, eliminating the need for Validator Challenges and ensuring more reliable Beacon
events.

Off-Chain PoC moves the responsibility of validating all PoC events to dedicated Oracles, powerful
machines that ingest completed challenges, verify challenges and, witness validity, then inject the
results back into the Helium L1 blockchain for rewards to be issued.

Oracles interact with data and systems outside of a native blockchain environment where the
processing can be completed much more efficiently and at scale, providing a solution to a
fundamental limitation of smart contracts.

Off-Chain PoC is essential in implementing HIP-70 and the Helium Network's migration to the Solana
blockchain and is a significant step forward in increasing the usability and scalability of the
Network.

:::info What happens to Challenger Rewards?

Validators were previously awarded Challenger Rewards for creating Proof of Coverage challenges.
These rewards are now redistributed to Hotspots as part of the Proof-of-Coverage pool, returning the
0.9% of overall HNT rewards to Validators to Beaconing and Witnessing Hotspots.

## Proof of Coverage Roles

The "challenge" is the discrete unit of work for Proof of Coverage. To date, 10s of millions of
challenges have been issued and processed by the Helium blockchain.

PoC Challenges involve three distinct roles:

### Beaconer

Sometimes called the "Challengee", this Hotspot is the target of the POC challenge. It is
responsible for transmitting (or "beaconing") challenge packets to be witnessed by geographically
proximate Hotspots.

### Witness

Hotspots that are geographically proximate to the Beaconer and report the existence of the
transmitted challenge packet. Any Hotspot hearing the transmitted packet will serve as a Witness and
submit their Witness report over gRPC.

### Oracle

Oracles are powerful machines that ingest completed challenges, verify the challenge and witness
validity, and then inject the results back into the Helium L1 blockchain for rewards to be issued.
In addition, oracles interact with data and systems outside of a native blockchain environment,
providing a solution to a fundamental limitation of smart contracts.

  <summary>History of PoC Roles</summary>

The Proof of Coverage model has continued to evolve to better suit the needs and capabilities of the
Helium Network.

The Consensus Group, a group of Hotspots elected by the blockchain to progress block production,
issued challenges in early iterations of the PoC algorithm. Eventually, as the number of active
Hotspots grew, [HIP-55](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0055-validator-challenges.md) was
proposed and voted on by the community to move Consensus Groups, and the "Challenger" role to
Validators, much more powerful machines capable of handling the ever-growing volume of data and
connections on the Network.

Even farther back in history, and before
[HIP-15](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0015-beaconing-rewards.md), Proof of Coverage
relied entirely on beaconing. A beacon was a single transmission witnessed by any Hotspot. Previous
versions used multi-hop challenge paths that didn't accurately test Hotspots' ability to capture RF
packets.

## PoC Reward Scaling

In every epoch, rewards split amongst Hotspots that had a role in that reward pool.

For example, a Hotspot might earn a "reward unit" for witnessing a beacon. If five additional
Hotspots successfully witnessed a beacon during the epoch, each earning a "reward unit." In that
case, each Hotspot gets 1/6th of the 20% of rewards in that epoch.

With the activation of [HIP-15](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0015-beaconing-rewards.md)
and
[HIP-17](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0017-hex-density-based-transmit-reward-scaling.md),
we introduced the idea of scaling these "reward units," so the units earned when being witnessed or
witnessing a packet scale depending on two things:

1. The number of witnesses, as detailed in HIP-15
2. The number of Hotspots in the hex tile of the transmitter, detailed in HIP-17

The HIPs themselves provide a rich explanation of these mechanisms, so you're encouraged to read
those, but they can be summarized as follows:

**From HIP-15**

> For the Transmitters, the more witnesses, the more the transmitter earns;

> For the Witness, each additional witness past a total of four reduces what is earned by each
> witness in that challenge.

**From HIP-17**

> The Witness earns less if the number of Hotspots in the area of the transmitter exceeds the
> "target density." Target density varies by hex resolution, as detailed in the HIP and defined in
> several chain variables.
